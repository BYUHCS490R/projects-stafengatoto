        <section class="poem">
            <p>Never did I ask for pain<br>
                nor all the damaged I gain<br>
                everything happened in an instant,<br>
                that I could hardly even listen<br>
                broken glasses lying around<br>
                and I wondered if God doesn't love me<br>
                then why let this happen now.<br>
            </p>

            <p>My faith was just small then<br>
                a tremblling hurting start;<br>
                Yet through the hardship I felt<br>
                His nearness in my heart.<br>
            </p>

            <p>I later learn a hard lesson,<br>
                that this happened for a reason.<br>
                Miracles are real<br>
                and faith are meant to be tested.<br>
                And after every trial, and tears I could not hide<br>
                He never left my side.<br>
