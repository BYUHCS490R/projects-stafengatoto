        <h2>Why I love Comedy Movies?</h2>
            <p><strong>Fun to watch and they make us laugh and feel good.</strong> In a day full of stress and sadness because the real world has been too hard on you, a comedy movie would be really helpful making you laugh and forget about your sad moments. When we laugh we forget about our problems and feel more relaxed.</p>
            <p><strong>Funny situations and characters</strong>. You would notice that comedy shows has silly or exaggerated events and characters that are funny to watch. </p>
            <p><strong>They help us see things differently</strong>. Comedy movies can turn something serious or serious topics into something easier to understand or cope with it.</p>
