            <p id="deem">One of my biggest interest growing up even now is <span class="dif">Volleyball</span>. I have been playing volleyball ever since I was 9 years old. We have a volleyball court close to our house and all the kids and a lot of people in our town would come there to play. <span class="dif">Whenever my school finishes I would always look forward to go back home and change to play volleyball.</span> It was always hard at first but all my uncles they play volleyball and I always look up tp them.</p>
            <p id="nimp">After primary school I continued to middle schools and high school and I still played volleyball. And my teams would always win and got the champioship. One of my biggest achievements is that <span class="dif">I was appointed the MVP for my whole country under 18 volleyball for the whole high school in Tonga</span>. Upto now I still go play volleyball but not that much because I have a lot of homeworks and also I work too, but I would always look for available time to go play.</p>
