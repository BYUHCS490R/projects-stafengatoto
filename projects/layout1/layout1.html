            <h2>Liahona High School</h2>
            <p>Liahona High School is a high in Tonga, founded in 1948 and it is operated by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. This school is named after Liahona, a religious artifact in the Book of Mormon.</p>
            <p>Liahona High School has a purpose which is the school's objective is to deepen conversion to Jesus Christ and His restored gospel and to prepare students to become leaders and serve in their communities.</p>
            <p>A lot of kids here graduated and went on to continue their studies at Brigham Young University of Hawaii.</p>
           <p>In this school they teach academic stuff and religious stuff too. I really love it there when I went to school. Teachers are not allowed to hit the students and also this is an English emersion school which Tongan speaking is not allowed at the school.</p>
