    <h1>Liahona High School</h1>
    <p>Aloha, My name is <u>Sione Tafengatoto</u>, I grew up in Tonga and I attended <strong>Liahona High School</strong> from grade 9 to 12. Liahona High School is located in Nuku'alofa, Tonga, is a private secondary school. The school is known for its moral integrity and community service.</p>
    <p>Liahona High School is considered one of the best school in Tonga because of its strong academic reputation and high pass rates. The school doesn't only just focus on academic but also are also exposed to religion classes run by the LDS church. The school also have wonderful teachers and staff all graduates from BYU Hawaii, and the campus itself is really beautiful and close to the temple to visit.</p>
