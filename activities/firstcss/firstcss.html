        <h1>CSS: Cascading Style Sheets</h1>
        <p>You can use CSS iin three different ways: inline css, embedded or external. Inline CSS goes right inside the tag and just changes that specific element. Embedded CSS sits in a style tag within your HTML file and affects only that page. External CSS lives in its own .css file that's linked to your HTML, which means it can style multiple pages at once.</p>
        <p>It's better to use external css since it puts all your styles in a single file, making your code more manageble. Plus you can update how multiple pages look without having to touch each one individually.</p>
        <p>A selector helps you pick which HTML element you want to style using CSS.</p>
