        <li>What is the difference between block tags and inline tags? - The inline tags stay in the same line as other content and only take up as much space as needed like 'span' or 'a'. But block tags create a big section on a line and takes up full width like 'div' and 'header'.</li>
        <li>What is the margin, border, and padding? - Margin is the space outside the border and the border is the line that goes around the text. Padding is the space inside the border.</li>
        <li>What are units of measurement you can use in CSS? - Units you can use are px, cm, %, and rem.</li>
        <li>When would you use a figure tag? - You can use a figure tag when you want to include a image.</li>
